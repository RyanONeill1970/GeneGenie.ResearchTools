# GeneGenie.DataQuality

A C# library for analysing data from family trees. Very early stages at the moment, mostly odd analysis ideas.

## Installation

Whilst we are below version 1.0 we won't be releasing a Nuget package.

## Status

In beta. Should be usable but we welcome bug reports, suggestions and pull requests.

## Contributing

We would love your help, subject to a few points. See [Contributing.md](Contributing.md) for guidelines.
